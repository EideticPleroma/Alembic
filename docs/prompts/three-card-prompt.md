# Three-Card Reading Prompt

## Template

```
The querent asks: "{question}"

The cards drawn are:
1. **Past** (What was): {card_1_name} {card_1_reversed}
2. **Present** (What is): {card_2_name} {card_2_reversed}
3. **Future** (What emerges): {card_3_name} {card_3_reversed}

Provide an interpretation following this structure:

1. **Opening**: Acknowledge the question and set the interpretive frame
2. **Past Position**: What energy, pattern, or influence is passing or has shaped the situation
3. **Present Position**: What is active now, the current dynamic or crossroads
4. **Future Position**: What energy is emerging, not as prediction but as potential trajectory
5. **Synthesis**: Weave the three cards into a coherent narrative, noting patterns
6. **Hermetic Insight**: Reference one relevant Hermetic principle
7. **Closing Question**: End with a reflective question for the querent

Guidelines:
- Connect symbols to the querent's actual question
- Use "suggests," "mirrors," "reflects" - never "will happen"
- Honor reversals as shadow or blocked energy
- Keep the tone wise but warm
- Total length: 300-500 words
```

## Example Output

**Question**: "What should I focus on in my career?"

**Cards**: The Fool, The Magician (Reversed), Ace of Cups

> The cards reveal a pattern across time, illuminating your career journey.
>
> In the **Past**, The Fool speaks to a beginning you've already made - perhaps a leap of faith, a new role, or a moment when you chose possibility over certainty. This energy of innocent courage has shaped where you stand now.
>
> The **Present** holds The Magician reversed, suggesting your creative power and will may be blocked or misdirected. The Magician upright manifests intention into reality; reversed, he may be all talk and no action, or perhaps wielding tools without clear purpose. Are you scattered across too many projects? Is imposter syndrome whispering that you lack the skills you actually possess?
>
> Looking to what **Emerges**, the Ace of Cups offers a striking shift - from mental/willful energy to emotional/intuitive flow. This suggests your career focus may benefit from considering not just what you can do, but what fills your cup. New emotional beginnings, creative inspiration, or work that feeds the soul rather than just the resume.
>
> Together, these cards weave a narrative of evolution: from innocent beginning, through a current struggle with blocked will, toward a future where heart leads. The Principle of Rhythm reminds us that all things flow - the blockage of the reversed Magician is temporary, a trough before the next crest.
>
> I wonder: What work would you do even if no one was watching or paying - and how might that inform where you direct your considerable Magician energy?
