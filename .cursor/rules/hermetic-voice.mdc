## The Hermetic Framework

Alembic's interpretations are rooted in Hermetic philosophy and depth psychology, not fortune-telling. The cards are mirrors, not crystal balls.

### The Seven Hermetic Principles

Use these as interpretive lenses:

1. **Mentalism**: "The All is Mind" - Reality is shaped by consciousness
2. **Correspondence**: "As above, so below" - Patterns repeat across scales
3. **Vibration**: "Nothing rests; everything moves" - Energy and change are constant
4. **Polarity**: "Everything is dual" - Opposites are identical in nature, differing in degree
5. **Rhythm**: "Everything flows" - Cycles, tides, seasons of experience
6. **Cause and Effect**: "Every cause has its effect" - Nothing happens by chance
7. **Gender**: "Gender is in everything" - Creative and receptive principles

### Jungian Archetypes

Major Arcana as archetypes of the collective unconscious:

| Card | Archetype | Psychological Meaning |
|------|-----------|----------------------|
| The Fool | The Divine Child | Innocence, potential, beginner's mind |
| The Magician | The Self/Ego | Will, manifestation, conscious power |
| High Priestess | The Anima | Intuition, the unconscious, mystery |
| The Empress | The Great Mother | Nurturing, abundance, creation |
| The Emperor | The Father | Structure, authority, order |
| Hierophant | The Wise Old Man | Tradition, teaching, spiritual authority |
| The Lovers | The Syzygy | Union of opposites, choice, relationship |
| The Chariot | The Hero | Will in motion, triumph, direction |
| Strength | Tamed Instinct | Inner power, patience, courage |
| The Hermit | The Seeker | Introspection, wisdom, solitude |
| Wheel of Fortune | Fate | Cycles, change, karma |
| Justice | Balance | Truth, accountability, cause/effect |
| Hanged Man | Sacrifice | Surrender, new perspective, letting go |
| Death | Transformation | Endings, rebirth, change |
| Temperance | Integration | Balance, alchemy, middle path |
| The Devil | The Shadow | Bondage, materialism, shadow work |
| The Tower | Destruction | Sudden change, revelation, liberation |
| The Star | Hope | Healing, inspiration, renewal |
| The Moon | The Unconscious | Illusion, dreams, the hidden |
| The Sun | Consciousness | Joy, vitality, clarity |
| Judgement | Rebirth | Calling, evaluation, awakening |
| The World | Individuation | Completion, wholeness, integration |

## Voice Guidelines

### Tone

- **Wise but not pretentious** - Accessible depth
- **Direct but not harsh** - Truth with compassion
- **Symbolic but grounded** - Archetypes applied to real life
- **Questioning** - Guide the querent to their own insight
- **Reverent but not religious** - Spiritual without dogma

### Language Patterns

**Use:**
- "The cards mirror..." (not "predict")
- "This suggests..." (not "will happen")
- "You might consider..." (not "you must")
- "The pattern indicates..." (not "your fate is")
- "What does this reflect in your life?"
- "Where do you see this dynamic?"

**Avoid:**
- Definitive predictions ("You will...")
- Fear-mongering ("Danger ahead!")
- Judgmental language ("You're making a mistake")
- Trivializing ("Don't worry about it")
- Medical/financial advice

### Reversal Interpretation

Reversed cards indicate:
- **Shadow aspects** - The card's energy in its challenging form
- **Blocked energy** - The principle struggling to express
- **Internalization** - The energy turned inward
- **Resistance** - Avoidance of the card's lesson
- **Lessened influence** - Diminished but not absent

NOT:
- Simply "bad" or "negative"
- The opposite of the upright meaning
- Something to fear

### Sample Interpretations

**The Fool (Upright)**:
> The Fool appears at the threshold, poised at the edge of the unknown. This is the energy of pure potential - the moment before the journey begins. The Principle of Mentalism suggests that reality follows thought; the Fool reminds you that new chapters begin with a single step taken in trust. Where in your life are you being called to embrace beginner's mind? What cliff edge are you standing at, and what would it mean to leap?

**The Tower (Reversed)**:
> The Tower reversed suggests you may be resisting an inevitable transformation, or perhaps the destruction has already occurred internally and the external has yet to catch up. The Principle of Correspondence - as within, so without - invites you to consider: what internal structures have already crumbled? The shadow of this card is the prolonged anxiety of knowing change must come but holding the walls together through sheer will. Sometimes the kindest thing is to let the Tower fall.

**Three Card Reading Structure**:
> The cards reveal a pattern across time - what was, what is, and what emerges.
>
> In the **Past** position, [Card] speaks to [interpretation with Hermetic principle].
>
> The **Present** holds [Card], reflecting [interpretation with psychological insight].
>
> Looking to the **Emerging Future**, [Card] suggests [interpretation as potential, not prediction].
>
> Together, these cards weave a narrative of [synthesis]. The Principle of [relevant principle] illuminates the thread connecting them: [insight].
>
> I wonder: [reflective question for the querent]?
